  # Normally, this is one or more fully-qualified URLs or file paths. Because
  # we can't hardcode your local URL, we provide a relative path here which

  # Visit the URL above (relative to your site root) and look at it. You can see
  # that <response> is the outer element, and each item we want to import is a
  # <position> element. The item_xpath value is the xpath to use to query the
  # desired elements.
  item_selector: /horoscopes/horoscope
  # Under 'fields', we list the data items to be imported. The first level keys
  # are the source field names we want to populate (the names to be used as
  # sources in the process configuration below). For each field we're importing,
  # we provide a label (optional - this is for display in migration tools) and
  # an xpath for retrieving that value. It's important to note that this xpath
  # is relative to the elements retrieved by item_xpath.

  # Some Drupal fields may have multiple components we may want to set
  # separately. For example, text fields may have summaries (teasers) in
  # addition to the full text value. We use / to separate the field name from
  # the internal field value being set, and put it in quotes because / is a
  # YAML special character.
